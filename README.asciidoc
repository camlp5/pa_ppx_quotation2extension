`pa_ppx_quotation2extension`: maps Camlp5 quotations to PPX extensions
======================================================================
:toc:
:toc-placement: preamble

This is a really small and simple PPX rewriter, that maps an extension like

```
[%foo {|...|}]
```
into a Camlp5 quotation
```
<:foo<...>>
```

and 
```
[%foo.loc {|...|}]
```
into
```
<:foo:<...>>
```

It depends on `pa_ppx_regexp`, or I'd just fold it into `pa_ppx`.
